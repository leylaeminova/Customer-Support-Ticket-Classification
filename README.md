# Customer-Support-Ticket-Classification

Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a Customer Support Ticket dataset along with the code for training a machine learning model to predict ticket types using ticket descriptions.
Dataset

The Customer Support Ticket dataset used in this analysis contains information about support tickets raised by customers. It includes features such as ticket subject, ticket description, and ticket type.
Data Exploration

  The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
  Visualizations and summary statistics are used to identify patterns, trends, and insights in the data.

Preprocessing

  Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, cleaning text data, and encoding categorical variables.
  Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and cleaning are applied to the ticket descriptions.

Model Training

  A machine learning model is trained to predict ticket types based on ticket descriptions.
  Various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are explored, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
